        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

        <p>>> We are an trust working for poor children's education and health across the World.Your donation will help us provide food, nutrition, hygiene items to poor children.</p>

        <p>>> Children who live below the poverty stand the risk of being malnourished and overweight, compromising their confidence and learning ability. Further, the impact on education is exacerbated by their family, who are unable to provide a responsive stimulating environment for their children.</p>

        <p>>> We believe that children who have good social relationships have greater self esteem than those who do not and are less likely to experience mental health problems including depression and anxiety. There is also evidence that pro-social behaviour during childhood leads to better psychological health in adulthood.</p>

        <p>>> So we as an organization would like to support the poor children for their education and health through your donations.<br>Please donate and help the needy...!!!</p>
